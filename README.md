# Cat-Shop
My final react project, I decided to make a webpage for cats!

It isn't 100% finished but the main idea is there a few things I missed to do, I couldnt make the faker infomation on each card random on them individally, I also couldnt make the div cards redirect you to the application page, but other than that and a few css issues the webpage is about where I want it.
